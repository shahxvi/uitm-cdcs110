# CDCS110 - Diploma in Computer Science

This repository serves as a compilation of materials, code, and projects that I have developed throughout my ongoing **Diploma in Computer Science** program.

### Current Courses:
- **CSC121** - Introduction to Algorithm Design & Development  
  **Lecture**: Siti Sarah binti MD Ilyas  
  **Lab**: Ts. Jamal bin Othman  
  - In this course, we primarily use **Flowgorithm** to design algorithms visually (flowchart), before translating them into actual code and pseudocode.

- **CSC126** - Fundamentals of Algorithm & Computer Problem Solving  
  **Instructor**: Nora Yanti binti Che Jan  
  - This is where most of the raw coding (using **C++**) takes place. It focuses on building a strong understanding of algorithms and problem-solving strategies through hands-on programming.

- **CSC253** - Interactive Multimedia  
  **Instructor**: Nor Arzami bin Othman  
  - This is where we learn about text, audio, graphics, hyperlinks, authoring tools, and more. The course explores both the technical and creative aspects of multimedia development.

### Other Semester 1 Courses:
- **MAT133** - Pre-Calculus  
  Covers foundational mathematics concepts that support problem-solving and logical thinking in computer science.

- **CTU101** - Prinsip-prinsip Asas Islam  

  An introduction to the fundamental principles and teachings of Islam.

- **LCC111** - English for Communicative Competence I
  The basics of english to acquire competence in communication.
