# CDCS110 - Diploma in Computer Science

This repository serves as a compilation of materials, code, and projects that I have developed throughout my ongoing **Diploma in Computer Science** program.

### Current Courses:
- **CSC121** - Introduction to Algorithm Design & Development  
  **Lecture**: Siti Sarah binti MD Ilyas  
  **Lab**: Ts. Jamal bin Othman  
  In this course, we primarily use **Flowgorithm** to design algorithms visually, before translating them into actual code. This approach helps to understand the logic behind algorithms before diving into raw coding.

- **CSC126** - Fundamentals of Algorithm & Computer Problem Solving  
  **Instructor**: Nora Yanti binti Che Jan  
  This is where most of the raw coding (using **C++**) takes place. It focuses on building a strong understanding of algorithms and problem-solving strategies through hands-on programming.

- **CSC253** - Interactive Multimedia  
  **Instructor**: Nor Arzami bin Othman  
  A course focused on creating interactive multimedia applications, exploring both technical and creative aspects.

### Branches:
- **`sem1`**: This branch contains coursework and projects completed during **Semester 1** (24/04/2025 - 13/07/2025).

This repository will be continuously updated with new work and projects as I progress through my program.
